The first version of the code was implemented using "brute force". The logic seems to be correct, however the code is  too slow, with test cases 10 and 11 failing due to timeout.

The second version of the code improved in terms of speed. The substitution of the "if" statements with "try - except" commands allowed it to pass test case 10, but not 11.
